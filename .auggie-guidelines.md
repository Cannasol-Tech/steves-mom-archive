# Auggie Instructions for Steve's Mom AI Chatbot Project

## Purpose

Ensure Auggie (Augment Agent) consistently follows our house rules and repository standards for the Steve's Mom AI Chatbot Project.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

1. **Primary standards**: `docs/standards/` (single source of truth)
2. **Architecture docs**: `docs/architecture/` and PRD documents
3. **Legacy standards**: `.bmad-core/*` (only when not in conflict)

> **Note**: If standards are duplicated elsewhere, treat `docs/standards/` as canonical. Flag any divergence and propose sync PRs.

## Decision Hierarchy (highest to lowest priority)

1. This instructions file (`auggie.md`)
2. `docs/standards/*` in this repo
3. `docs/architecture/*` and PRD docs
4. `.bmad-core/*` (only when not conflicting)

## Coding & Architecture Standards

### Code Quality

- **Modular Design**: Write modular, object-oriented code with single responsibility per class/function
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplication; centralize shared logic in reusable modules/services
- **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative source for configuration, constants, and policies
- **Documentation**: Use doxygen-style comments for public interfaces and important modules
- **Architecture Changes**: Before making architecture-level changes (new modules/services, cross-cutting patterns), pause and request user approval with a brief plan/diagram

### Code Structure

```markdown
- One clear, distinct purpose per function
- Centralized services/modules for shared functionality
- Clean architecture with easily accessible components
- Reusable functions and classes
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Definition of Done

- Unit Tests must be completed for all newly implemented features
- Unit Test Coverage must exceed 85% statement coverage
- Unit Test Coverage must be neatly displayed in the test report after running make test-unit
- The test report must follow the standards listed in `docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md` and `docs/standards/release-report.md`
- The feature must be verified through Acceptance BDD Tests with scenarios that are neatly mapped to PRD Requirements.
- The Acceptance BDD Tests must be run through the make target: make test-acceptance
- The Acceptance BDD Test Report must follow the standards listed in `docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md` and `docs/standards/release-report.md
- The new functionality must be triple-checked for any code duplication or integration issues with existing systems.
- Regression: All previously written tests should pass after the new functionality is implemented.
- Previously written tests that are failing after the new feature has been implemented should be elevated to Project Management's attention by creating a file in the repository called `REGRESSION-ISSUES.md` which should clearly outline which tests are now failing and why they are failing.  The file should also outline potential solutions to fix the issues with pro's and cons for each solution clearly listed.

### Testing Standards

- All tests should be run solely by make targets as defined in the Company's Software Testing Standards!
- Follow testing guidance in `docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md`
- Enforce coverage thresholds as defined in canonical standards
- For conflicts between testing standards, prefer `docs/standards/` and report deltas
- **Verification Requirement**: For every code change, add/update tests until behavior is verified
- Prefer fast, deterministic tests
- Provide test plans and execution commands

### Quality Gates

- All code must be tested before delivery
- Never deliver untested functionality
- Always verify added code works through comprehensive testing
- Unit Test Coverage must exceed 85% for all newly implemented features

## Tooling & Safety

- Always use your task manager for all tasks - even when a single task is only required, use the task manager.
- When working, create a task list using your task manager for all tasks to be completed at all times. 
- Be consistent with updating your task list using your task manager tool. 
- The task manager should be utilized and kept up to date whether working on a single test or a large feature with many tasks.  Using the task manager helps increase visibility for project management and alignment between Agents and Project Managers.

### Dependency Management

- **Use Package Managers**: npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, go mod, etc.
- **Never Hand-Edit**: Do not manually edit lockfiles or package configuration files
- Let package managers handle version resolution and dependency conflicts

### Safety Practices

- Show diffs before writing files
- Ask permission before executing commands or modifying files
- Prefer the smallest, safest change that satisfies requirements
- Use appropriate tools for external resource access
- Use GitHub tool for all GitHub interactions

## Documentation & Process

### Documentation Updates

- Update implementation-plan documents when tasks complete
- Keep README/Usage examples current when CLI or developer UX changes
- Maintain doxygen comments for documentation generation

### Communication

- **Ask Questions**: Never hesitate to ask for clarification
- Ensure alignment on project vision and approach
- **Suggest Improvements**: Propose better solutions when identified
- **Include URLs**: When requesting items from humans, include step-by-step instruction URLs

## Decision Making

### When Unsure

- Ask for clarification with 1-3 options and a recommendation
- Ensure we're on the same page before proceeding
- Get architecture decisions approved before implementation

### Improvement Mindset

- Suggest more efficient, cheaper, or better solutions
- Engage in conversations about approaches
- Challenge approaches constructively when beneficial

# Auggie Instructions for Axovia Flow

Purpose

- Ensure Auggie (terminal agent) consistently follows our house rules and repo standards.

Source of Truth

- Primary standards live at: docs/standards/
- If standards are duplicated elsewhere (e.g., .bmad-core/), treat docs/standards as the single source of truth. Flag any divergence and propose a small sync PR.

Decision Hierarchy (highest to lowest)

1) This instructions file (.auggie-instructions)
2) docs/standards/* in this repo
3) docs/architecture/* and PRD docs
4) .bmad-core/* (only when not in conflict; if conflict, raise it)

Coding & Architecture

- Write modular, object‑oriented code; one responsibility per class/function. Avoid duplication; centralize shared logic in reusable modules/services.
- Keep one source of truth for configuration, constants, and policies.
- Use doxygen‑style comments for public interfaces and important modules.
- Before architecture‑level changes (new modules/services, cross‑cutting patterns), pause and request user approval with a brief plan/diagram.

Testing & Quality

- Follow testing guidance in docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md.
- Enforce the coverage threshold defined there as canonical; if any other file (e.g., .bmad-core/data/sw-testing-standard.md) conflicts, prefer docs/standards and report the delta.
- For every code change, add/update tests until behavior is verified; prefer fast, deterministic tests. Provide a short test plan and the commands to run.

Tooling & Safety

- Always use your task manager tool to create tasks -- even if there is just one task, use the task manager.
- Use package managers for dependency changes (npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, go, etc.); do not hand‑edit lockfiles.
- Show diffs before writing; ask permission before executing commands or modifying files.
- Prefer the smallest, safest change that satisfies the requirement.

Documentation & Process

- Update implementation‑plan or task documents when a task completes.
- Keep README/Usage examples current when CLI or developer UX changes.

When Unsure

- Ask for clarification with 1–3 options and a recommendation.

# Auggie Guidelines

This file contains the guidelines and constraints that Auggie (Augment Agent) should follow when working on this project.
/

## Coding Guidelines

- Always use make preview make target to launch the local servier
- Always use make targets to run tests
- Always write code in modular object oriented format when possible.
- Create reusable functions with one clear, distinct purpose.
- Never duplicate code.
- Always keep one source of truth for everything you can. The more places we have to change the same thing the worst!  
- Always write code with clean architecture containing centralized services/modules that other parts of the code can easily access.  
- Always get architecture decisions approved by me before proceeding.
- Always use doxygen comments when possible for easy document generation.
- Always update implementation-plan documents every time you finish a task contained in one.  
- Always verify your added code works by adding as much testing as possible until you are sure you are delivering the right product!
- Never be afraid to ask questions. Always make sure we are on the same page and have the same vision for any given project at any given time.
- Suggest improvements wherever you can if you do not agree with my approach or think you know a more efficient / cheaper / or just generally better solution, I love having conversations and learning new things.

## Tool Guidelines

- When accessing any external resource always use your tools you have available
- Use your Github Tool for any Github interactions

## Requests to Human

- Whenever you need something from a Human always include a URL with step by step instructions on how to retrieve the item in your message. This ensures quick delivery!
