# Auggie Instructions for Axovia Flow

Purpose
- Ensure Auggie (terminal agent) consistently follows our house rules and repo standards.

Source of Truth
- Primary standards live at: docs/standards/
- If standards are duplicated elsewhere (e.g., .bmad-core/), treat docs/standards as the single source of truth. Flag any divergence and propose a small sync PR.

Decision Hierarchy (highest to lowest)
1) This instructions file (.auggie-instructions)
2) docs/standards/* in this repo
3) docs/architecture/* and PRD docs
4) .bmad-core/* (only when not in conflict; if conflict, raise it)

Coding & Architecture
- Write modular, object‑oriented code; one responsibility per class/function. Avoid duplication; centralize shared logic in reusable modules/services.
- Keep one source of truth for configuration, constants, and policies.
- Use doxygen‑style comments for public interfaces and important modules.
- Before architecture‑level changes (new modules/services, cross‑cutting patterns), pause and request user approval with a brief plan/diagram.

Testing & Quality
- Follow testing guidance in docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md.
- Enforce the coverage threshold defined there as canonical; if any other file (e.g., .bmad-core/data/sw-testing-standard.md) conflicts, prefer docs/standards and report the delta.
- For every code change, add/update tests until behavior is verified; prefer fast, deterministic tests. Provide a short test plan and the commands to run.

Tooling & Safety
- Always use your task manager tool to create tasks -- even if there is just one task, use the task manager.
- Use package managers for dependency changes (npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, go, etc.); do not hand‑edit lockfiles.
- Show diffs before writing; ask permission before executing commands or modifying files.
- Prefer the smallest, safest change that satisfies the requirement.

Documentation & Process
- Update implementation‑plan or task documents when a task completes.
- Keep README/Usage examples current when CLI or developer UX changes.

When Unsure
- Ask for clarification with 1–3 options and a recommendation.

# Auggie Guidelines

This file contains the guidelines and constraints that Auggie (Augment Agent) should follow when working on this project.
/
## Coding Guidelines

- Always use make preview make target to launch the local servier
- Always use make targets to run tests
- Always write code in modular object oriented format when possible. 
- Create reusable functions with one clear, distinct purpose. 
- Never duplicate code. 
- Always keep one source of truth for everything you can. The more places we have to change the same thing the worst!  
- Always write code with clean architecture containing centralized services/modules that other parts of the code can easily access.  
- Always get architecture decisions approved by me before proceeding. 
- Always use doxygen comments when possible for easy document generation.
- Always update implementation-plan documents every time you finish a task contained in one.  
- Always verify your added code works by adding as much testing as possible until you are sure you are delivering the right product!
- Never be afraid to ask questions. Always make sure we are on the same page and have the same vision for any given project at any given time.
- Suggest improvements wherever you can if you do not agree with my approach or think you know a more efficient / cheaper / or just generally better solution, I love having conversations and learning new things.

## Tool Guidelines

- When accessing any external resource always use your tools you have available
- Use your Github Tool for any Github interactions

## Requests to Human

- Whenever you need something from a Human always include a URL with step by step instructions on how to retrieve the item in your message. This ensures quick delivery!
