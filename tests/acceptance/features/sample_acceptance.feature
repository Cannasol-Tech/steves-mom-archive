Feature: Sample acceptance scaffold
  As a team
  I want a minimal acceptance test scaffold
  So that the Make target can demonstrate report generation

  Scenario: Placeholder passes trivially
    Given a working repository
    When I run a no-op acceptance step
    Then the placeholder should pass
