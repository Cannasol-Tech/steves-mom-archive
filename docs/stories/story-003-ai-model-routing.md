# User Story 003: AI Model Routing

**As an architect**, I want an intelligent model router **so that** we can efficiently manage multiple AI providers and handle failures gracefully.

## Description
This story involves the `ModelRouter` class, which is responsible for selecting the appropriate AI provider based on a defined policy (e.g., cost, latency).

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `ModelRouter` can be configured with multiple `LLMProvider` instances.
- It supports routing strategies like `COST_OPTIMIZED`, `LATENCY_OPTIMIZED`, and `FAILOVER`.
- The router checks provider rate limits before sending a request.
- It implements a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable failing providers.
- The router includes logic for retries with exponential backoff.
- The configuration can be loaded from environment variables or a dictionary.
