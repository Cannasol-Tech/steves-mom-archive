# ADR-002: Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine

**Date**: 2025-08-29

**Status**: Proposed

## Context

The application requires a robust system to manage and coordinate multiple specialized AI agents to fulfill complex user requests. This involves breaking down tasks, dispatching them to appropriate agents, and managing state throughout long-running workflows. The solution must be scalable, resilient, and fit within our serverless Azure architecture.

## Decision

We will use **Azure Durable Functions** to implement the multi-agent orchestration engine.

The proposed architecture is as follows:

1.  **Orchestration Trigger**: An HTTP-triggered Azure Function serves as the entry point.
2.  **Durable Orchestration Client**: This entry point function will initiate a new durable orchestration instance for each user request.
3.  **Orchestrator Function**: This function will define the agent workflow. It will call one or more 'Activity Functions' (agents) in a sequence or in parallel (fan-out/fan-in pattern), manage state, and handle logic based on agent outputs.
4.  **Activity Functions (Agents)**: Each agent will be an independent Activity Function responsible for a specific capability (e.g., planning, coding, database interaction, user approval). The orchestrator passes inputs to them and awaits their results.
5.  **State Management**: The Durable Functions extension will automatically persist the state of the orchestration in Azure Storage, ensuring reliability and traceability.
6.  **Real-time Communication**: The orchestrator will leverage the Azure SignalR service to push real-time status updates and results back to the client.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Stateful Workflows in Serverless**: Natively supports long-running, stateful operations within a serverless model, which is traditionally stateless.
*   **Resilience**: Automatic checkpointing and state persistence mean workflows can reliably run for hours or days and are resilient to function restarts or infrastructure issues.
*   **Scalability**: Leverages the inherent scalability of the Azure Functions platform.
*   **Complex Patterns**: Simplifies the implementation of complex patterns like fan-out/fan-in, chaining, and human interaction.
*   **Observability**: Provides a clear history of each orchestration instance, which is invaluable for debugging and auditing.

### Negative

*   **Increased Complexity**: Introduces a new concept and programming model that the development team will need to learn.
*   **Storage Dependency**: Creates a tight dependency on Azure Storage for state management, which becomes a critical component.
*   **Cost**: While generally cost-effective, long-running or high-throughput orchestrations will incur costs related to both function executions and storage transactions.
