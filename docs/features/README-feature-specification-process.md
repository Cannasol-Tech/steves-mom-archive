# Feature Specification Process

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic process for creating detailed feature specifications for Steve's Mom AI Chatbot project. Each feature in the implementation plan requires a comprehensive specification before development begins.

## Process Flow

### 1. Pre-Development Requirements

Before starting any feature implementation:

1. **Complete Competency Assessment** (`capabilities/competency-assessment.md`)
   - Assess technical skills and experience relevant to the feature
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
   - Document confidence level and execution approach

2. **Create Feature Specification** (`docs/features/feature-[ID]-[name].md`)
   - Use the template: `docs/features/TEMPLATE-feature-specification.md`
   - Reference PRD sections and implementation plan tasks
   - Define clear acceptance criteria and testing strategy

3. **Update Implementation Plan**
   - Mark feature as "In Progress" with agent assignment
   - Update task status and branch information
   - Add any new subtasks or dependencies discovered

### 2. Feature Specification Template Usage

Use `docs/features/TEMPLATE-feature-specification.md` as the starting point for all new feature specifications.

**Naming Convention**: `feature-[SECTION.TASK_ID]-[descriptive-name].md`

Examples:
- `feature-3.2-chat-input-messages.md`
- `feature-4.1-grok-provider-clients.md`
- `feature-5.3-approval-handler.md`

### 3. Required Sections

Every feature specification must include:

- **Overview**: Purpose, business value, success metrics
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements from PRD
- **Technical Specification**: Architecture, APIs, data models, integrations
- **Implementation Plan**: TDD approach, tasks, risk assessment
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy and definition of done
- **Documentation**: User, technical, and API documentation needs
- **Deployment**: Environment requirements and rollout strategy
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Must have, should have, could have features

### 4. MVP Feature Priorities

Based on the implementation plan, create feature specifications in this order:

#### Week 1 MVP Features (High Priority)
1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Section 1)
   - `feature-1.1-azure-resources-iac.md`
   - `feature-1.2-provision-azure-resources.md`
   - `feature-1.3-azure-functions-setup.md`
   - `feature-1.4-repository-dev-environment.md`
   - `feature-1.5-static-web-app-config.md`

2. **Chat Interface Foundation** (Section 3)
   - `feature-3.1-ui-shell-routing-layout.md`
   - `feature-3.2-chat-input-messages.md`
   - `feature-3.3-streaming-display-controls.md`

3. **AI Integration** (Section 4)
   - `feature-4.1-grok-provider-clients.md`
   - `feature-4.2-model-router.md`
   - `feature-4.3-context-manager.md`

#### Week 2 MVP Features (Medium Priority)
4. **Task Management** (Section 5)
   - `feature-5.1-intent-detection.md`
   - `feature-5.2-task-schema-crud.md`
   - `feature-5.3-approval-handler.md`
   - `feature-5.4-ui-approve-reject.md`

5. **System Integrations** (Sections 6-9)
   - `feature-6.1-inventory-client.md`
   - `feature-7.1-nl-sql-templates.md`
   - `feature-8.1-email-integration.md`
   - `feature-9.1-document-templates.md`

6. **Authentication** (Section 10)
   - `feature-10.1-azure-ad-auth.md`

### 5. Quality Standards

Each feature specification must meet these standards:

- **Completeness**: All template sections filled with relevant information
- **Traceability**: Clear references to PRD requirements and implementation plan tasks
- **Testability**: Specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- **TDD Focus**: Test-first development approach clearly defined
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, business, and timeline risks identified with mitigations

### 6. Review and Approval Process

1. **Self-Review**: Author reviews specification against template and quality standards
2. **Peer Review**: Another team member reviews for completeness and clarity
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Product owner approves business requirements alignment
4. **Technical Review**: Lead developer approves technical approach
5. **Final Approval**: Mark specification as "Complete" and ready for implementation

### 7. Maintenance and Updates

- Update feature specifications as requirements change during development
- Mark specifications as "Complete" when feature is fully implemented and tested
- Archive completed specifications for future reference and lessons learned

## Tools and Resources

- **Template**: `docs/features/TEMPLATE-feature-specification.md`
- **PRD Reference**: `docs/prd-v1.0.0/` (sections 1-19)
- **Implementation Plan**: `docs/planning/implementation-plan.md`
- **Competency Assessment**: `capabilities/competency-assessment.md`

## Next Steps

1. Complete competency assessments for upcoming features
2. Create feature specifications for Week 1 MVP features
3. Begin implementation following TDD approach outlined in specifications
4. Update implementation plan with progress and results
