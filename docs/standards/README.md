# Project Standards Documentation

This directory is used for storing all company-wide project standards.  This includes the coding standards, testing standards, and any other standards related documents.  This directory should be the single source of truth for all project standards.  The coding standards should definitely live here and any other standards related documents should also be stored here for a given project.
