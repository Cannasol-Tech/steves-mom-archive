# Epic 003: Infrastructure and CI/CD

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want a fully automated infrastructure and deployment pipeline **so that** we can deliver features reliably and efficiently.

## Description
This epic encompasses all the work related to defining the application's infrastructure as code (IaC), setting up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and configuring robust monitoring and logging.

## User Stories
- [STORY-007]: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- [STORY-008]: CI/CD Pipeline
- [STORY-009]: Monitoring and Logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- All Azure resources are defined in Bicep templates.
- The infrastructure can be deployed to multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) using parameter files.
- GitHub Actions workflows automatically build, test, and deploy the frontend and backend.
- The static web app and function app are deployed successfully.
- Application Insights is configured for both frontend and backend to track performance and errors.
- Logs are centralized and can be easily queried.
