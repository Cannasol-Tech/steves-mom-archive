# Epic 002: Task Management and Admin

**As a developer/agent**, I want to manage AI-generated tasks contextually and view performance analytics **so that** I can provide efficient feedback and monitor the AI's effectiveness.

## Description
This epic covers the refactored task management workflow and the admin dashboard. Task interaction is now handled in a contextual side panel within the chat interface, while a dedicated page provides historical analytics. The admin dashboard remains for system configuration.

## User Stories
- [STORY-004]: Task Management Page
- [STORY-005]: Admin Dashboard
- [STORY-006]: Backend Task API

## Acceptance Criteria
- Developers can interact with AI-generated tasks via a slide-out panel in the chat interface.
- A dedicated analytics page displays historical task data (e.g., acceptance/rejection rates).
- Task data is scoped to be private to the session to protect sensitive information.
- An admin dashboard provides an overview of system status and configuration options.
- The backend provides secure API endpoints for all task and admin operations.
