**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Agent**: John (Project Manager)
**Document Reviewed**: `docs/prd.md` (Version 1.1)

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness**: 98%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase**: Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps**: The PRD is outstanding. The only minor gaps are a lack of explicit user research data and documented rationale for some technical choices. Neither of these are blockers.

## Top Issues by Priority

- **BLOCKERS**: None.
- **HIGH**: None.
- **MEDIUM**:
    - It would be beneficial to create lightweight Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document the *why* behind key technology choices.
    - Consider adding an appendix with any raw user feedback or survey results that informed the requirements.

## Final Decision

The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides a clear and actionable plan for development.

**Final Decision: READY FOR ARCHITECT**
