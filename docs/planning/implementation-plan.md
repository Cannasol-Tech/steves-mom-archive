# Implementation Plan: Steve's Mom

This document outlines the development phases for building the application based on the finalized architecture.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Backend Setup

*   **Objective**: Provision all Azure resources and set up the basic backend structure.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Provision Azure resources via Bicep (SQL, SignalR, Function App, etc.).
    *   [ ] Set up database schema using Alembic migrations.
    *   [ ] Create initial Azure Function stubs for `chat`, `tasks`, and `approve`.
    *   [ ] Implement basic health check endpoint.
    *   [ ] Configure connection strings and secrets in Key Vault.

## Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality

*   **Objective**: Implement the real-time chat interface and connect it to the backend.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Develop React components: `ChatInput`, `MessageList`.
    *   [ ] Integrate SignalR client in the frontend to connect to the backend.
    *   [ ] Implement the `chat` function to receive messages, process them with a simple AI model (e.g., echo), and broadcast them back.
    *   [ ] Store conversation history in the Azure SQL database.

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

*   **Objective**: Build the Durable Functions-based orchestration engine.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Create the main Orchestrator Function.
    *   [ ] Develop initial Activity Functions (Agents) for `Planning` and `ToolUse`.
    *   [ ] Integrate the AI Model Router to select the appropriate model (GROK, GPT, etc.).
    *   [ ] Refactor the `chat` function to trigger the orchestration workflow.

## Phase 4: Task Management and Admin Features

*   **Objective**: Implement the task approval and admin dashboard features.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Develop the `approve` function and integrate human-in-the-loop flow with the orchestrator.
    *   [ ] Create the `tasks` API to list and manage tasks.
    *   [ ] Build the Admin Dashboard UI to display tasks and approval history.
    *   [ ] Implement Azure AD authentication for the admin section.

## Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, and Finalization

*   **Objective**: Ensure the application is robust, tested, and ready for production.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend functions and frontend components.
    *   [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
    *   [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of all features.
    *   [ ] Finalize documentation and prepare for handoff.
