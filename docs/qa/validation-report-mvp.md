# QA Validation Report: MVP Artifacts

**Status**: Approved

## 1. Summary

This report validates the artifacts created for the Steve's Mom AI Chatbot MVP, including the Product Requirements Document (PRD), all user stories (STORY-001 to STORY-009), and the Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001).

**Conclusion**: The artifacts are deemed **complete, consistent, and testable**. The project is ready to proceed to the development phase.

## 2. Artifact Review

- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: The PRD is clear and comprehensive. It effectively communicates the product vision, goals, and scope for the MVP. The success metrics are well-defined and measurable.
- **User Stories**: All user stories are well-formed, following the "As a..., I want..., so that..." format. The acceptance criteria are specific, unambiguous, and provide a clear basis for test case development.
- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**: The ADR clearly justifies the architectural choices. The decision to use a decoupled architecture with React, FastAPI, and Azure Bicep aligns with the requirements for scalability and maintainability.

## 3. High-Level Test Strategy

To ensure quality, we will adopt a multi-layered testing approach:

- **Unit Testing**:
  - **Frontend**: Jest and React Testing Library will be used to test individual React components.
  - **Backend**: Pytest will be used to test individual functions, classes (like `ModelRouter`), and API endpoints in isolation.
  - **Coverage Goal**: >85% for both frontend and backend.

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Tests will verify the interaction between the frontend and backend API.
  - We will test the full flow from a user sending a message to the backend routing it to the AI provider and returning a response.
  - We will also test the integration with the Azure SQL database for the task management feature.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**:
  - We will use a framework like Playwright or Cypress to simulate user journeys through the deployed application.
  - Key scenarios to test: user login, sending a chat message, receiving a streamed response, creating and completing a task.

- **Infrastructure Testing**:
  - Bicep deployment scripts will be tested using the `what-if` operation to preview changes before deployment.
  - We will implement basic smoke tests to verify that all deployed resources are operational.

## 4. Next Steps

With this validation complete, the project can confidently move to the development phase, starting with the implementation of the user stories. The QA team will begin preparing detailed test cases based on the approved acceptance criteria.
