# Competency Assessment â€” augment-02

## Feature: 1.4.MY Incremental mypy hardening for backend/ai/

- Area: Python typing, mypy configuration, test-driven development
- Relevant Experience: Implemented strict typing across AI provider/router stacks; authored DTOs and Protocols for model routing and provider abstractions.
- Strengths: SOLID design, clean architecture, incremental refactors with high test coverage.
- Risks: Potential hidden dynamic behaviors in provider modules; will mitigate with targeted tests and incremental flags.
- Confidence: High

## Execution Plan (High Level)

1) Start with base provider and model_router (already partially strict in mypy.ini) and ensure clean types.
2) Add DTOs/Protocols to clarify request/response shapes.
3) Expand to config_manager and provider modules; remove ignore_errors entries gradually.
4) Keep tests green at each step; update planning docs per protocol.
